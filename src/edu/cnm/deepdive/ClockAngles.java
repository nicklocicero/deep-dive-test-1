/**
 * The static methods of this class compute the angles to which the hands of a
 * clock will be oriented at a given time of day.
 * <p>
 *   Some of the method names contain the word "Degrees". The value returned by
 *   each of these should be an angle in degrees, measured clockwise from
 *   straight up (12 o'clock on the clock face). Another way to think of this
 *   angle is that it follows the conventions used when reading a compass. The
 *   values returned should be in the interval [0, 360) &ndash; that is, from 0
 *   (inclusive) to 360 (exclusive).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Other methods contain the word "Radians"; these methods (for extra credit)
 *   should return angles in radians, measured counter-clockwise from the
 *   positive X-axis (3 o'clock on the clock face). In other words, these angles
 *   follow the conventions of analytic geometry. The value returned by each of
 *   these methods should be in the range [0, 2&pi;).
 * </p>
 * <h3>Assumptions</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The value of the <code>hours</code> parameter will always be in the
 *   range 0 to 23, inclusive. (Note that your code shouldn't care whether a
 *   12-hour or 24-hour clock is being used.)</li>
 *   <li>The value of the <code>minutes</code> parameter will always be in the
 *   real-valued interval [0, 60) &ndash; that is a floating-point number
 *   ranging from 0 (inclusive) to 60 (exclusive).</li>
 *   <li>The angle of the minute hand doesn't depend at all on the hour;
 *   however, the angle of the hour hand depends on both hour and
 *   minutes, since the hour hand on the clock face advances even as the
 *   minutes advance.</li>
 *   <li>Since non-integral computations are almost always inexact, results
 *   need only be accurate to within 0.01&deg;, or (approximately) 0.00017
 *   radians.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h3>Basic test cases</h3>
 * <p>
 *   Please note that the values below are guaranteed to be included in the test
 *   cases; others may be included at our discretion. However, if your code
 *   works correctly with the cases below, and assuming it doesn't simply have
 *   hard-coded conditions looking for these specific inpupt values, it should
 *   have no problem with additional test values. In other words, your code
 *   should include the necessary computations to handle general cases, and not
 *   just those shown here.
